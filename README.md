### Campaign Strategy for Chair of Downtown Campus

#### Increase Student Perks
- **Downtown Deals for Students**: I will negotiate discounts with local businesses to help students save money on essentials like food, fitness, and study-friendly spaces.
- **Why This Matters**: Downtown Vancouver is expensive, and this program will reduce financial stress for students.

#### Clarifying My Role as Liaison
- **BCIT Downtown Pulse**: A digital platform where students can anonymously submit concerns, ideas, and feedback.
- **Why This Matters**: Instead of just passing along concerns, I will actively work with students and BCIT to implement real changes.

#### Advocating for Visibility
- **Equal Treatment for Downtown Campus**: I will push for Downtown Campus to be fully included in BCIT-wide initiatives, ensuring access to the same resources as Burnaby Campus.
- **Increased Funding**: I will advocate for more financial support for student clubs, events, and resources at Downtown Campus.
- **Better Study Spaces**: I will push for improved study areas, better seating, and access to quiet spaces.
- **Representation in Decision-Making**: I will work to ensure Downtown Campus students are considered in major BCIT policy decisions.
- **Why This Matters**: Downtown students often feel overlooked. I will make sure we have the same opportunities and recognition as Burnaby students.

#### Career Fairs & Networking
- **Lunch & Launch**: A monthly networking event where industry professionals visit Downtown Campus for casual discussions over lunch.
- **Bringing Employers to Campus**: I will organize employer meetups so students donâ€™t have to travel to Burnaby for career fairs.
- **Industry-Specific Networking**: I will arrange sessions focused on tech, business, and other fields relevant to Downtown Campus students.
- **Why This Matters**: Many students struggle to attend Burnaby career events due to commuting time. By hosting these opportunities at Downtown Campus, networking and job access become much easier.

#### Campus Events & Club Activities
- **BCIT Connect**: Speed-friending and networking events where students can build friendships and professional relationships over snacks.
- **BCIT Chill Week**: A pre-exam wellness event with therapy dogs, meditation, and art therapy to help students relax.
- **Partnering with Local Businesses**: I will collaborate with businesses to sponsor or host events at Downtown Campus.
- **Student-Driven Events**: I will actively gather feedback on what events students want and work to make them happen (e.g., board game nights, social mixers, cultural events).
- **Why This Matters**: A vibrant campus community makes student life more enjoyable and helps build valuable connections.

#### Promoting a Stronger Community
Beyond academics, I will advocate for mental health resources, additional study spaces, and mentorship programs. By fostering an inclusive and engaging campus, I will ensure every student feels supported.

I aim to bridge the gap between Downtown and Burnaby campuses, making sure we have equal opportunities, support, and recognition at BCIT.
