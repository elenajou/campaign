    <section id="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Elena Jou, a Term 3 CST student in the co-op program with experience in the tech industry. Coming from the Burnaby campus, I’ve seen firsthand how different the student experience is for Downtown students. We have talented, hardworking students, but we lack the same career opportunities, networking events, and campus support as I’ve seen in Burnaby. That’s why I’m running, to ensure we get the resources, recognition, and opportunities we deserve.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about ensuring Downtown Campus students receive the same recognition and resources as Burnaby students.</p>

        <h2>Q&A</h2>
        <h3>What is the Chair of Downtown Campus and what do they do?</h3>
        <p>The Chair of Downtown Campus represents the voice of BCIT's Downtown students, ensuring our needs are heard by the administration and creating opportunities for professional and social growth.</p>

        <h3>How am I going to make a change?</h3>
        <p>I will create programs like 'BCIT Downtown Pulse' for feedback, 'Lunch & Launch' for networking, and 'Downtown Deals for Students' for discounts. I will work to bridge the gap between Downtown and Burnaby campuses.</p>
